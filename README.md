# **GPURenderer**  

**GPURenderer** is a lightweight and easy-to-use wrapper for Unityâ€™s `Graphics.Draw` API, designed to simplify GPU instancing. Unity's built-in GPU instancing can be tricky to set up, and this tool removes much of the hassle while making instanced rendering more accessible.  

## âœ¨ **Features**  
This asset provides a streamlined way to render meshes efficiently, without relying on traditional GameObjects. It includes:  

- ðŸš€ **Instanced Mesh Rendering** â€“ Take full advantage of GPU instancing for improved performance.  
- ðŸŽ­ **Object Rendering Without GameObjects** â€“ Draw objects directly, avoiding unnecessary overhead.  
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Enable/Disable System** â€“ Easily toggle objects on and off at runtime.  
- ðŸ›  **Custom Inspector Window** â€“ View and manage currently instanced meshes with additional details.  
- ðŸ“œ **Automatic GameObject Instancing** â€“ A component-based script to automatically convert GameObjects into instanced objects.  
- ðŸ”Œ **Interface-Based Drawing** â€“ Implement a simple interface to render objects via classes, without requiring `MonoBehaviour`.  
- ðŸ“‚ **Collection-Based Rendering** â€“ Organize meshes into collections, and easily create or delete entire collections.  

## ðŸ”§ **Usage & Contribution**  
This asset is developed and maintained by me as a personal project. Feel free to use, modify, and adapt it however you like! Contributions are always appreciated, but there's no pressureâ€”just have fun with it.
